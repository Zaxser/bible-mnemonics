        When going through each verse, each verse will have a mnemonic to help 
        you remember it better. It's easier to remember the verse with the help
        of the first letters. To better remember the letters, we think about
        them as a PAO - Person Action Object - system. Every third word in our
        mnemonic for the first letters of each word of a verse will an object.
