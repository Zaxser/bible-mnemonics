        When going through each verse, each verse will have a mnemonic to help 
        you remember it better. Each verse will be a room, and, to remember the 
        chapter, there will be something special about the floor of each room.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the floor is {{ChapterMnemonic}}, what chapter will we be in?
